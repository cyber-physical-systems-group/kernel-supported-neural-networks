# Tests

Directory with python unit tests and partial E2E tests for certain models. Those are used to make sure models (such as 
Nadaraya-Watson) are working as expected and following the theory derived for them.

Example train and test data for deterministic Nadaraya-Waston model is stored in the `resources` directory.
