    This class contains training module for neural network to identify nonlinear dynamical systems or static nonlinear
    functions with guarantees by using bounded activation incorporating theoretical bounds from the kernel regression
    estimator. The approach is limited to finite memory single-input single-output dynamical systems,
    which can be converted to static multiple-input single-output systems by using delay-line.

    Bounds are computed using kernel regression working with the same data, but we are able to guarantees of the
    estimation, which are used to activate a network during and after training, in order to ensure that the predictions
    are never outside of those theoretical bounds.

    Bounds can be also used as penalty during training, which is implemented in this class using `BoundedMSELoss`.

    This module contains non-trivial torch device settings, since memory manger and network are independent.
    `memory_device` contains device used for memory manager, which is used to access training data and for
    non-parametric estimator and `predict_device` contains device used for inference, which is used for network and
    memory, which can be CPU or GPU (if memory manager supports it).
